  |   In the tight confines of the space freighter, standing still is not   |
  |   an option. Your ability to dodge around enemies is as important as    |
  |   your aim. Survival requires quick thinking and rapid reflexes and a   |
  |   true master of the dance is a beautiful thing to behold.              |

  |   or grenades will spawn in the vending machines whilst crate drops     |
  |   containing special abilities, sidearms, perks and defense moves are   |
  |   also random, adding further to the mind-boggling possible             |
  |   combinations.                                                         |

  |   A wealth of weapons, sidearms, special abilities, perks,              |
  |   explosives, defense moves and character skins awaits you. Each new    |
